### Part 1 - SSIM
Image Quality Assessment: From Error Visibility to Structural Similarity
source: https://www.cns.nyu.edu/pub/eero/wang03-reprint.pdf

####Structural Similarity Index
#### full-reference image quality assessment
mean squared error (MSE)，  peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)：physical meanings, mathematically convenient, but not perceive visual quality

#### IMAGE QUALITY ASSESSMENT BASED ON ERROR SENSITIVITY
##### Framework
pre-processing: scale and align; transform into a color space (more appropriate for the HVS ??); convert the digital pixel values into luminance values of pixels; a low-pass filter(simulate the point spread function of the eye optics??)

CSF filtering: the contrast snesitivity function 

Channel Deconposition:

Error Normalization: Minkowski norm

##### limitations
The Quality Definition Problem

The Suprathreshold Problem

The Natural Image Complexity Problem

The Decorrelation Problem

The Cognitive Interaction Problem

#### take advantage of known characteristics of human visual system (HVS)
